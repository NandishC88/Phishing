Phishing Email Analysis Report

Objective:
Identify and list phishing indicators in a suspicious email sample to improve threat analysis and security awareness.

1. Sample Phishing Email

Subject: Your Microsoft Office 365 account will be suspended — Action Required Immediately
From: Microsoft Support <support@microsfot-security.com>
To: user@example.com

Email Body:

text
Dear Customer,

We detected unusual activity in your Microsoft Office 365 account and have temporarily restricted access for your safety.  

To avoid permanent suspension, please verify your account within 24 hours by clicking the link below:

Failure to verify your account within the time frame may result in permanent account termination.

Best regards,  
Microsoft Account Security Team  


2. Analysis and Phishing Indicators

Sender Email Address (Spoofing)
The sender’s address uses "microsfot-security.com" (misspelled), impersonating "microsoft.com".

Attackers often register domains with minor spelling changes to fool users.

The actual domain is not affiliated with Microsoft and uses a suspicious "-security" suffix.​

Email Header Discrepancies
Fake emails may come from servers with no connection to the real organization (different IP/routing).

SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication records would likely fail or be missing.

The “Return-Path” and “Reply-To” addresses usually don’t match the official company.​

Suspicious Links
The visible link claims to go to "microsoft-secure-login.com" (fake).

Hovering the link would show a mismatch from official Microsoft domains.

Phishing links try to trick victims into sharing passwords or personal information on false login pages.​

Urgent and Threatening Language
Email uses urgency: "Action Required Immediately", "temporarily restricted", "verify your account within 24 hours", "permanent suspension".

Phishing commonly deploys threats or deadlines to create panic and prompt quick, careless action.

Attachments (if present)
While none in this sample, phishing emails often include malicious attachments (.exe, .zip, or infected documents).

Grammar and Spelling Errors
The email uses a generically addressed greeting ("Dear Customer") instead of your real name.

Minor language errors and awkward phrasing are present — often a sign of phishing.​

Mismatched URLs
The link text says Microsoft but the domain is fake ("microsoft-secure-login.com").

Always check URLs carefully and do not trust the visible part—hover to see the real target address.​

3. Summary of Phishing Traits Found

Misspelled sender domain, clearly imitating the real brand.

Absence or failure of official email authentication records upon header inspection.

Mismatched or suspicious website link.

Threatening, urgent language meant to intimidate and force instant action.

Absence of personalized greeting, indicating mass spamming.

Minor grammar and phrasing issues.

No genuine corporate contact or footer information.

4. Recommendations

Always verify the sender’s address and domain.

Use a header analyzer tool to check for signs of email spoofing.

Never click suspicious links or download unexpected attachments.

Be wary of urgent requests and always verify with the company directly using official contact information.
